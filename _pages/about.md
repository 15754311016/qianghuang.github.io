I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). I am currently a visiting scholar at University of Southern California (USC), working with [Prof. Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan).

My research interests include causal inference, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, utilizing the causal mechanism to develop fair, robust machine learning algorithms to aid decision-making and applications in the real world.
