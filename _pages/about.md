I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). I am currently a visiting scholar at University of Southern California (USC), working with [Prof. Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan).

My research interests include causal inference, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, utilizing the causal mechanism to develop fair, robust machine learning algorithms to aid decision making and applications in the real world.
